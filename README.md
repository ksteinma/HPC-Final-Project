# HPC Final Project

This is our final project for the High Performance Computing class at Colorado School of Mines. This project's goal is to create a fast implementation of DeBruijn Graph creation and Euler Cycle finding. 

## Getting Started

You will need to install the Bcalm library [here](https://github.com/GATB/bcalm) and follow there installation instructions. The bcalm repo should be placed in the folder for this project. 

Run make from the main folder to create the hpc executable. 

Input to the naive implementation using bcalm, takes in fastq files. The current implementation uses a file called hg00096.fastq. This can be changed in the source.cpp file. 

### Prerequisites

bcalm, make, and gcc.
